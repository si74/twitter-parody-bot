In honor of the time change @chopracenter put together a 6-question quiz to help your lifestyle Take it here: 
Existence is a mystery. Science is a system of rational thought without knowing what thought is. 
Sensations images feelings &amp; thoughts are excitations of awareness interpreted by awareness as mind body &amp; universe‚Ä¶ 
Homo Sapiens is also a construct in awareness 
The entire universe including your  body is a mental construct.Reality is awareness &amp; its self modifications as sense perceptions &amp; thoughts
So do wave functions live in mental space as mathematical abstractions ?

Your eyes capture photons, your brain receives electrical signals, you see a 3 D world.  In every act of perception you create the universe.
